Ispy v0.25
====

<b>I am discontinuing Ispy to work on another project that will replace it. Ispy itself has many design flaws which 
cannot be fixed easily and was experimental, I'll keep the repo up for a while until I decide to delete it</b>

Note: will only work with 2.7.x versions of python, will not work with 3.x

An interpreter with a REPL for my design of a lisp variant, Ispy.


To run in REPL, or interactive mode navigate to the src folder open a terminal and type `python __init__.py`
to run with a file type `python __init__.py file_name.isp`

Change Log
  
  added global variables through set and get
  
  new math expressions sq, sqrt
  
  seperated `__init__.py` and `main.py` into seperate files
  
  added function definitions
